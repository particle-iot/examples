This is me trying to learn this stuff!

Blinking an LED is the "Hello World" example of the microcontroller world. Itâ€™s a nice way to warm up and start your journey into the land of embedded hardware. 

Required Materials
---

* a LED (optional)
* a Resistor (optional)

Note, that if you don't have these two things, the example will still work, and simply blink the on-board LED instead of the external one.
The value of the resistor doesn't matter much, something around 330 Ohms will work.

Note, LEDs have polarity (i.e. they only work when the "+" and "-" are wired correctly), the illustrated bent LED wire above corresponds to the physical LED wire that is longer.

How to Use
---

There isn't much to this. 1) flash it, 2) watch the LED blink, 3) fork the example, 4) try the activities below.

Activities

### Change the blink rate

- Change the `1000` in the `delay(1000)` to `250`, flash it, watch it blink faster!
- You can also make it turn on/off longer or shorter be varying the two numbers in `delay()`, watch it blink differently!

  eg. Slow blink (Short On, Long Off)

```
  digitalWrite(D0,LOW);  //turn off LED
  delay(500);            //wait for 500ms
  digitalWrite(D0,HIGH); //turn on LED
  delay(1000);            //wait for 1s
```
      
### Make external LED less bright

In hardware:

   1. Change the 330 Ohm resistor to a 1K Ohm. You will notice that the LED becomes much dimmer.
